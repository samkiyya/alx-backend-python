This repository contains projects aimed at learning and applying backend development concepts using **Python**. The focus is on enhancing code clarity, performance, and robustness through best practices like type annotations, duck typing, and static code validation.

## Features

- **Type Annotations**: Improve code readability and reliability by specifying variable types and function signatures.
- **Duck Typing**: Implement dynamic typing while ensuring code flexibility and correctness.
- **Mypy Validation**: Validate the codebase using `mypy` for static type checking, catching errors early.
- **PEP8 Compliance**: Adhere to Python's PEP8 style guide for cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Projects Overview

1. **Type Annotations in Python**  
   Learn to use Python's built-in type hinting to specify variable types, function parameters, and return types.

2. **Duck Typing**  
   Understand and apply duck typing, which focuses on the behavior of objects rather than their explicit types.

3. **Static Code Validation with Mypy**  
   Validate the entire codebase using `mypy` to catch type-related errors before runtime.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Install `mypy` for static type checking:
  ```bash
  pip install mypy
  ```

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samkiyya/alx-backend-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-python
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts:
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py
   ```
4. Validate code with `mypy`:
   ```bash
   mypy script_name.py
   ```
